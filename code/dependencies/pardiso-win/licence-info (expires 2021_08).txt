Save the key -- without surrounding whitespace -- in a file named 'pardiso.lic' and read the manual for further information on where to put this file. It only works with the most recent PARDISO version.

You can find a mailing list for the solver at:

  https://www.maillist.unibas.ch/mailman/listinfo/pardiso

This list serves as a discussion forum for the parallel sparse direct solver PARDISO. Topics appropriate for this list include bug reports, installation problems, performance reports, and user experiences.


We kindly want to remind you to inform us about details (title, author(s), URL, etc) of any report or publication you write and where PARDISO software was utilised to produce or confirm results.

This notification has to be sent to:
